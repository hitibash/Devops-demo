# DevOps Demo Project

## 🧾 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete DevOps pipeline and infrastructure using modern tools and best practices. It includes a containerized Flask application with a MySQL backend, CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, Kubernetes orchestration via k3s, and a monitoring stack using Prometheus and Grafana.

## 🧱 Technologies Used

- **Flask** – Python web framework for the app
- **MySQL** – Relational database
- **Docker** – Containerization
- **Jenkins** – Continuous Integration and Deployment
- **Trivy** – Security vulnerability scanning
- **Kubernetes (k3s)** – Lightweight K8s distribution for orchestration
- **Helm** – For installing Prometheus and Grafana
- **Prometheus + Grafana** – Monitoring and dashboards

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Summary

- Flask App is containerized and deployed via Jenkins to a k3s cluster.
- MySQL is deployed with persistent volume and initialized via a Kubernetes Job.
- Secrets are managed using Kubernetes Secrets (Base64-encoded).
- CI pipeline includes:
  - Linting and testing
  - Image build and Trivy scan
  - Push to DockerHub
  - CD to k3s using `kubectl apply`
- Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana via Helm in `monitoring/` namespace.

## 📁 Folder Structure

| Folder         | Description                                         |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `app/`         | Flask application code                              |
| `tests/`       | Integration tests for database connectivity         |
| `k3s/`         | All Kubernetes YAML files and manifests             |
| `monitoring/`  | Helm values, dashboard exports, and README for monitoring setup |
| `jenkins/`     | Jenkins pipeline configuration (if applicable)      |

## 🔁 CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD is managed through a Jenkins pipeline that performs the following steps:
1. **Workspace CleanUp**
using cleanWs()
2. **Clone the Repository**
3. **Build Docker Image** 
4. **Run Tests** (`run-tests.py`)
5. **Scan Image** using Trivy
6. **Tag Docker Image**
using build number as versioning
7. **Push to DockerHub**
8. **Deploy to Kubernetes** via `kubectl` and template substitution

---

## ☸️ Kubernetes Deployment

The application is deployed on a local **k3s** cluster. Key components:

- `deployment.template.yaml`: Template for Flask app Deployment
- `db_deployment.yaml`: MySQL Deployment
- `db_pvc.yaml`: Persistent volume for database storage
- `db_init_job.yaml`: Initializes the database schema
- `secrets.yaml`: Kubernetes Secrets (base64-encoded)

📖 For full details, see [`k3s/README.md`](./k3s/README.md)

---

## 📊 Monitoring

Monitoring is handled via Helm charts in the `monitoring/` folder:

- Prometheus collects metrics
- Grafana displays dashboards (e.g. [ID 1860 – Kubernetes Cluster Monitoring (via Prometheus)](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/1860))
- Grafana is exposed via NodePort for browser access

📖 More info in [`monitoring/README.md`](./monitoring/README.md)

📝 **Note:** For further visibility, application-level metrics (e.g. request rates) can be added by integrating Prometheus client libraries. This was skipped to avoid code modifications.

---

## 🔐 Secrets & Configuration

- Environment variables are used extensively (following [12-Factor App](https://12factor.net/config) principles).
- Secrets and DB config are injected via Kubernetes Secrets.
- For dev environments, `.env` or default values are used.

📖 See [`app/README.md`](./app/README.md)

---

## 🧪 Testing

Database readiness and integration is tested using `tests/run-tests.py`.

- The script waits for MySQL to become available
- Connects and runs simple queries to verify schema and data

---

## 🧰 Local Development

To run the Flask app locally:

```bash
cd app
pip install -r requirements.txt
flask run
```

Or using Docker:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
